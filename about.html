                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Since 9th grade in 2008, I have wanted to make programs.  I learned my first programming language, 
                        QBASIC, when I took Programming I in high school.  I also learned Visual Basic the next year and 
                        ROBOTC the year after that.  Because of finances, I attended the local community college for an 
                        Associate Degree in programming.  I looked for a job for a year.  I had a nice temporary job at 
                        Dupont, migrating their computers.  I also spent some time with Pascagoula PC Repair on an as-needed 
                        basis, which was good, as I was introduced to Linux Mint and gained some practical knowledge of 
                        how computers work as a whole.  I finally found a regularly-scheduled job at a local grocery store,
                         where I saved up enough to go back to school for a Bachelorâ€™s.  I also met my wife there.  Now, I
                          am almost done with my second degree and live in a small house with my wife and cat.  I enjoy 
                          fishing, woodworking, listening to Classic Christian Music vinyl and tapes, and traveling to National Parks and other scenic areas.  I also realize how
                           much more I know about programming now than when I completed my first degree.  The first degree 
                           allowed me to know a little about networking, IT, database, web development, and programming.  
                           My second has allowed me to understand one or a few of those to a much better level.</p>
